copper heart
============
â™¥

introduction
------------
Copper Heart is an experiment. 

The first idea is to give us a way to receive monthly contributions 
from our friends, in the form of credit card payments.

The second idea is to convey where the contributions are going.

The third idea is to promote a dialog between the people receiving 
contributions and those providing them.

The main idea is to make a place where the meaning behind the money 
is brought to the forefront, and the numbers are an afterthought.

audience
---------
The current audience of Copper Heart is self-employed computer 
programmers, or friends of computer programmers, who want a neat 
funding platform and are willing to hack around to get things to
work for the time being.

The potential audience of Copper Heart is the self-employed, 
community-backed creators and volunteers of the world.

development state
------------------
Dear programmers, 

This project is leaving a prototype situation and entering rough draft
territory. That is, a few ideas are in place, implemented in a narrow
but not blind fashion, with minimal error checking.

To become a fully realized rough draft, a few rounds of usability 
improvements need to be executed, unit tests need to have their say,
reporting (errors and analytics) needs to be a thing, and performance
(or perceived performance) must have a glance.

end game
-----------
The first version of Copper Heart will be complete when:
* The rough draft outlined above is fully realized.
* Backers can subscribe to a newsletter from members.
* People can change Stripe accounts and the expected things happen.

The second version of Copper Heart will be complete when:
* The setup process for installing it on your server is straight-forward and simple.

A few ideas, in between:
* Show how close certain needs are to being met (e.g. rent).
